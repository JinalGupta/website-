<h4><center>What is HTML?</center></h4>
<p align="justify">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
