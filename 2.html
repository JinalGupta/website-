<h4><center>What is C?</center></h4>
<p align="justify">C (pronounced like the letter c) is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential.
By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly 
for application software.C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.</p>
<h4><center>Who invented the C language?</center></h4>

<p align="justify">Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (September 9, 1941 â€“ c. October 12, 2011) was an American computer scientist.
He is most well-known for creating the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system and B programming language.
Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999. 
Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007. He was the "R" in K&R C, and commonly known by his username dmr.</p>
<h4><center>Uses Of C languages</center></h4>
<p align="justify">C++ has a wide range of real-world applications, including the following:
