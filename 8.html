<p align="justify">Created by statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, R is used among data miners, bioinformaticians and statisticians for data analysis and developing statistical software.
Users have created packages to augment the functions of the R language.According to user surveys and studies of scholarly literature databases, 
R is one of the most commonly used programming languages used in data mining.As of October 2022, 
R ranks 12th in the TIOBE index, a measure of programming language popularity, in which the language peaked in 8th place in August 2020.</p>
<h4><center>Uses of R language</center></h4>
<p align="justify">R offers a wide variety of statistics-related libraries and provides a favorable environment for statistical computing and design. 
In addition, the R programming language gets used by many quantitative analysts as a programming tool since it's useful for data importing and cleaning.</p>
